I. FOUNDATIONS: CULTURE, COMPLEXITY & COGNITION

Introduces the core thesis: meaning is not a "nice-to-have" but the organising principle of modern work and cognition. Frames leadership as the cultivation of meaning.

2. Culture as a Co-Evolving Mind

Argues that culture is a cognitive ecology—an emergent distributed intelligence that evolves alongside humans via narrative, norms, and technology.

3. The Means of Meaning-Production

Explores who (or what) controls the systems that shape meaning in society: institutions, media, technology, AI. Advocates cultural cultivation over control.

4. The Lost Discipline: Why Philosophy Abandoned Culture

A historical look at how analytic and continental philosophy drifted away from the study of culture—and why the field must reunite with systems and memetics.

5. Truth, Context, and Evolution: Reuniting Science and Philosophy

Shows how scientific truth, philosophical meaning, and cultural context form a triad that must be integrated rather than opposed.

Proposes a modern, synthesis-driven philosophy of culture suited for digital, algorithmic, and accelerated memetic environments.

⸻

II. MEMETICS & SUBSTRATES

Fixes the memetic "substrate problem" by tracing how ideas replicate through narrative, language, melody, print, digital networks, and AI.

8. The Evolution of Cultural Substrates

A historical tour of how cultural replication has changed as its channels shifted—from oral tradition to digital media and large language models.

9. Memetic Ecology and Ethical Design

Explores the ethical responsibility of shaping environments where beneficial memes flourish and harmful ones wither.

10. Digital Platforms as Selection Environments

Shows how algorithms act as memetic evolutionary pressures that favour speed, emotion, and outrage over insight.

Contrasts Taylorism with modern complexity-aware, cognition-aware approaches to management.

16. Deming's Profound Knowledge and Pride in Workmanship

Reinterprets Deming as a philosopher of meaning: pride, dignity, and quality as moral imperatives.

17. The Toyota Way as a Rejection of Industrial Management

Explores Toyota as a case study in cultural ecology: systems that support autonomy, learning, and coherence.

18. The Human Side of Agile, DevOps, and Technical Leadership

Shows that agile rituals are memetic tools for stabilising shared understanding in complex work.

IV. COMPLEXITY, CYNEFIN, AND EMERGENCE

19. After Cynefin: From Sense-Making to Meaning-Making

Extends Snowden: from diagnosing complexity to cultivating emergent meaning within complex systems.

20. Complexity as Cultural Terrain

Argues that complexity is not a problem to solve but an ecology to inhabit.

Explores how coherence counteracts cognitive entropy and why psychological safety is a systemic requirement, not a soft-skill nicety.

⸻

V. EXISTENTIALISM, AGENCY & ENTROPY

22. Meaning as Negentropy

Frames meaning as the cognitive analogue of biological negentropy—life's rebellion against disorder.

23. Agency in a Deterministic Universe: Dennett's Imperative

Explains why acting as if agency is real is an ethical necessity, regardless of metaphysics.

24. Existentialism for Systems Thinkers

Reinterprets existentialism as a systems practice: choice as the creation of meaning within deterministic constraints.

⸻

VI. THE MATRIX SERIES (PHILOSOPHY THROUGH POP CULTURE)

25. The Matrix as a Parable of Memetic Ecology

Reads the films as an allegory of cultural replication, control, and resistance.

26. Purpose, Providence, and Coherence: The Morpheus Principle

31. AI as a Cultural Substrate: Why Context Is the Currency of Meaning

Shows how AI training corpora encode and reproduce cultural assumptions.

32. AI, Hegemony, and the Battle for the Global Meaning Substrate

Explores AI as memetic imperialism and why China/Russia/European Union fight for epistemic sovereignty.

33. Gen Z and the Demand for Meaning: The End of Burnout Culture

34. Why the 40-Hour Week Can't Survive Cognitive Labour (And Why AI Won't Save Us Without a Cultural Shift)

A historical-economic piece showing the mismatch between industrial labour models and cognitive work, and how cultural pathology prevents AI-driven productivity gains from translating into humane work conditions.

⸻

IX. PHENOMENOLOGY OF BURNOUT & TRANSFORMATION

Argues that existential burnout is the collapse of a meaning-structure—and the precondition for a new one.

36. The Black Strip: How Burnout Marked My Body, and How Meaning Returned

A phenomenological reflection on how burnout altered my physiology—and how coherence began healing it.
